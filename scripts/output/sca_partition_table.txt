SCA + MERGE AUDIT -- PARTITION DEFENSE SUMMARY
==========================================================================

Service Continuity Attestation (K = 10,000 epochs, ~69 days):

  Scenario                               1yr dilution    5yr dilution
  -----------------------------------  --------------  --------------
  No SCA (current design)                      19.96%          43.46%
  SCA only (K=10K)                             19.94%          43.42%
  SCA + audit (fresh IDs)                       0.00%           0.00%
  SCA + audit (1 trust link)                    0.00%           0.00%

Recommended: K = 10,000 epochs (~69 days)
  Fresh localhost attack: 0% dilution (fully blocked)
  Pre-planned: bounded to K epochs, visible on reconnect
  Legitimate village: mints for ~69 days, then pauses (can still transact)
