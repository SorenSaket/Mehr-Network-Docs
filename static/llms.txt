# Mehr Network

> Decentralized mesh networking infrastructure powered by Proof of Service. Free between friends, paid between strangers.

Mehr Network is an open protocol for decentralized mesh communication. It uses **Proof of Service** — tokens are minted only when nodes relay packets, store data, or run computations for real clients. The network operates on any transport (LoRa, WiFi, fiber, cellular) with full partition tolerance. Identity is self-sovereign and names resolve from the trust graph, not a global registry.
